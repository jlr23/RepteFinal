Frontend Web Development Project with Vue.js and API Integration
This project was created as part of my final work for the Advanced Frontend Web Development course. It showcases various development skills I have learned using Vue.js, and it integrates with a free, remote API (RetooltAPI).

Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to load and display data from an external API, which provides information about different characters. It focuses on the use of Vue.js for frontend development, handling data asynchronously, and rendering dynamic content.

API Integration
The project uses RetooltAPI, a free remote API. Please note that this API has certain limitations, such as rate limits and possible URL changes. If data does not load or the application does not function as expected, it might be due to these limitations, especially the varying URL.

Python Scripts
While the project includes Python scripts to load character data, these scripts do not create the database. Instead, they simply fetch data from the API and process it for display.

Technologies Used
Vue.js: For building the frontend and managing the user interface.
RetooltAPI: A remote API for character data.
Python: To retrieve and process data from the API.
How to Run the Project
Clone the repository:

bash
Copiar código
git clone https://github.com/your_username/your_repository.git
cd your_repository
Install dependencies for Vue.js:

bash
Copiar código
npm install
Run the application:

bash
Copiar código
npm run serve
Check the Python scripts in the /scripts/ folder for data loading from the API.

API Limitations
As mentioned earlier, the API has limitations, which may affect the functionality of the project. If you encounter any issues, please verify that the correct API URL is being used, as it may change.
